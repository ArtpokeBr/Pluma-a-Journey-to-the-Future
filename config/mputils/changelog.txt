§a§lVersion Beta§r§f 4.0.3:

BREAKING CHANGES:

All DevTech Items will not exist anymore. wich means, all Ore Processing Custom Items (Crystal, Shards, Clumps etc).
This is due to a Migration to ContentTweaker.

Also, some NuclearCraft Items/Blocks may break due to a migration to the Non-Overhauled Version.
(Not Guaranteed since the ID's should still be the same, but some content will be missing)
