; To change/remove/add/replace recipes, modify this file and put it in the
; "minecraft/config/ic2" folder. Do NOT modify the file inside of the IC2 jar file.
;
; furnace recipes are as follows:
;  <input> = <output>
;
; output:
;  <name>[@<metadata>][*<amount>]
;
; input:
;  <name>[@<metadata>][*<amount>]
;
; name references are only the following:
; - the global unique item name as introduced by MC 1.7 (mod id:registry name)
;
; the metadata is specified as follows:
; - not at all -> metadata 0 is required or for ore-dictionary names their original metadata
; - * -> any metadata is allowed, overriding ore-dictionary metadata values to acccept any
; - <some number> -> the specific value is required, overriding ore-dictionary specifications
;
; You can also optionally specify the amount of xp produced:
;  @xp:<amount>
;
; The value entered is in (potentially non-whole) xp points.
;
; Note: this is a Input = Output mapping.
